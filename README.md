# Flask ML API

## Technical aspects

The technologies involved are:
- Python is the main programming language
- Flask framework for the API
- HTML for the web UI
- Redis for the communication between microservices
- Tensorflow for loading the pre-trained CNN model
- Locust for doing the stress testing of your solution

## Installation

To run the services using compose:

```bash
$ cp .env.original .env
```

Only for mac M1 users:
- There is dockerfile for M1 macs model/Dockerfile.M1. This docker file downloads tensoflow compiled for M1
- Change docker-compose.yaml to use that docker file.
- Remove tensorflow for requirements.txt
- Remember change back docker-compose.yaml and requirements.txt in the submission.

Edit .env file and fill UID and GID env variables using command id -u and id -g.

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

To stop the services:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```


## Code Style

Following a style guide keeps the code's aesthetics clean and improves readability, making contributions and code reviews easier. Automated Python code formatters make sure your codebase stays in a consistent style without any manual work on your end. If adhering to a specific style of coding is important to you, employing an automated to do that job is the obvious thing to do. This avoids bike-shedding on nitpicks during code reviews, saving you an enormous amount of time overall.

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for automated code formatting in this project, you can run it with:

```console
$ isort --profile=black . && black --line-length 88 .
```

### 1. Modules

We make use of [multi-stage docker builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) so we can have into the same Dockerfile environments for testing and also for deploying our service.

#### 1.1. Api

Run:

```bash
$ cd api/
$ docker build -t flask_api_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

You will only need to pay attention to the logs corresponding to the testing code which will look like this:

```bash
#10 [test 1/1] RUN ["pytest", "-v", "/src/tests"]
#10 sha256:707efc0d59d04744766193fe6873d212afc0f8e4b28d035a2d2e94b40826604f

#10 0.776
#10 0.776 ============================== 4 passed in 0.24s ===============================
#10 DONE 0.8s
```

You are good if all tests are passing.

#### 1.2. Model

Same as api, run:

```bash
$ cd model/
$ docker build -t model_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

### 2. Integration end-to-end

You must have the full pipeline running (see previous section) and the following Python libraries installed:

- [requests==2.28.1](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [pytest==7.1.2](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)

You can install them using the file `tests/requirements.txt` with:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Then, from the project root folder run:

```
$ python tests/test_integration.py
```

If the output looks like this, then the integration tests are passing:

```bash
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.299s

OK
```
